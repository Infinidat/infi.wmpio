Invalid switch specified.

Used for any of the following tasks:
  - Display the hardware IDs of storage on the system.
  - Have MSDSM claim/unclaim MPIO support for passed-in device(s).
  - Display the current MPIO configuration.
  - Display/Set the Load Balance policy for a specific device, for devices with
    a specific hardware ID, or for all devices claimed by MSDSM.

Display available/MSDSM-supported storage usage: mpclaim  query_switch
 query_switch    Displays all storage that is of enterprise class (i.e.
                 Fibre, iSCSI, SAS) or MSDSM's supported device list.
       -e        Queries connected enterprise storage and displays as
                 vendor-product id strings.
       -h        Displays storages that MSDSM currently supports.

(Un)Claim usage: mpclaim reboot_opt claim_switch device_switch device_hwid(s)
 reboot_opt      Whether to automatically reboot or not
       -r        automatically reboot (if needed) without prompting.
       -n        Suppress reboot request (caller may need to reboot).
 claim_switch    Whether to add or remove multipath support (through MSDSM's
                 control).
       -i        Add multipath support for device.
       -u        Remove multipath support for device.
 device_switch   Whether to apply above options to all or passed-in devices.
       -d        Parameters following this switch indicate hardware IDs of
                 devices.
       -a        Work on all applicable devices.
       -c        Work only on all SPC3-compliant devices (Meaningful only for
                 claims. If used with '-u', it is treated as '-a'.)
 device_hwid     HardwareIDs of Devices to be MPIO'd, as strings of
                 vendor8product16, delimited by a space. (Use empty string
                 with '-a' option.)

Display/Set LB Policy usage: mpclaim operation apply_to parameters
 operation       Whether the policy settings should be set or shown.
       -s        Shows the load balance setting.
       -l        Sets the load balance setting.
 apply_to        Whether the command applies to a specific device, devices with
                 a specific Hardware ID, or devices claimed by MSDSM.
       -d        Operation applies to a specific device.
       -m        Operation applies to all devices controlled by MSDSM for
                 which the policy has not already been explicitly set.
       -t        Operation applies to all devices controlled by MSDSM with a
                 matching hardware ID for which the policy has not been
                 explicitly set.
 parameters      If using the '-s' operation switch:
                    The only meaningful paramter you can supply is an MPIO disk
                    number when using the '-d' apply_to switch.  In this case,
                    disk-specific information will be displayed.  If you do not
                    supply a disk number, all MPIO disks will be displayed with
                    some basic information about each.
                    When viewing information for a particular disk, an asterisk
                    preceding a displayed path indicates the preferred failback
                    path when the load balance policy is Fail-Over Only.  An
                    asterisk preceding a displayed TargetPortGroup indicates
                    that it is the preferred TargetPortGroup.

                 If using the '-l' operation switch:
                    Valid load balance policy parameters are:
                       0 = Clear the Policy
                       1 = Fail-Over Only
                       2 = Round Robin
                       3 = Round Robin with Subset
                       4 = Least Queue Depth
                       5 = Weighted Paths
                       6 = Least Blocks
                       7 = Vendor-Specific

                    With the '-t' apply_to switch, the paramter format is:

                       HardwareID LBPolicy

                       Hardware IDs can be obtained by using the '-e' switch as
                       mentioned above.
                       Policy can be any of the numbers above except for the
                       Round Robin with Subset nor Weighted Paths policies as
                       these require path-specific information to be set.
                       However, if Round Robin is set, any disks that are ALUA-
                       enabled will automatically have their policy set to
                       Round Robin with Subset.

                    With the '-m' apply_to switch, you simply need to specify
                    the policy number from above.  Note that you cannot set the
                    policy to Round Robin with Subset nor Weighted Paths as
                    these require path-specific information to be set.
                    However, if Round Robin is set, any disks that are ALUA-
                    enabled will automatically have their policy set to Round
                    Robin with Subset.

                    With the '-d' apply_to switch, the basic format is:

                       MPIODiskNumber LBPolicy

                       Depending on the policy chosen, there may be additional
                       parameters you need to specify.

                       For Fail-Over Only, it is okay to specify only the
                       Active/Optimized path. All other paths will be put in
                       Active/Unoptimized or StandBy state, unless their path
                       state is explicitly specified. In the case that the
                       current policy is already Fail-Over Only, the current
                       Active/Optimized path must be explicitly specified with
                       a non-Active/Optimized state along with the pathId that
                       needs to now be made Active/Optimized.  Format is:

                          PathID State Weight Preferred

                          State should be specified as follows:
                             0 = Active/Optimized
                             1 = Active/Unoptimized
                             2 = Standby
                             3 = Unavailable
                          Weight is ignored for this policy.
                          Preferred should be specified as follows:
                             0 = False
                             1 = True

                       For Round Robin with Subset, it is okay to only specify
                       the non-Active/Optimized paths. Paths not specified will
                       be set to either Active/Optimized or their corresponding
                       TargetPortGroup state.  Format is:

                          PathID State Weight Preferred

                          State should be specified as mentioned above.
                          Weight is ignored for this policy.
                          Preferred is ignored for this policy.

                       For Weighted Paths, path states will be set to either
                       Active/Optimized or the state of the corresponding
                       TargetPortGroup and path weights will default to '0' for
                       paths whose weights have never been explicitly set.
                       Format is:

                          PathID State Weight Preferred

                          State should be specified as mentioned above.
                          Weight must be specified as a positive integer.
                          Preferred is ignored for this policy.

                       For Least Queue Depth and Least Blocks, path states will
                       be set to either Active/Optimized or the state of the
                       corresponding TargetPortGroup.

 For a given disk claimed by MSDSM, the load balance policy levels have the
 following order of precendence:
    1. The policy explicitly set for the disk. (Via '-l -d' or the MPIO control
       panel applet.)
    2. The policy set for the hardware ID of the disk.  (Via '-l -t'.)
    3. The MSDSM-wide poilcy.  (Via '-l -m'.)
    4. Round Robin if disk is non-ALUA, Round Robin with Subset otherwise.
 Thus, if no policy is explicitly set for the disk itself, no policy is set for
 the hardware ID of the disk, but the MSDSM-wide policy is set, the disk will
 use the MSDSM-wide load balance policy.  However, if a policy is set for the
 disk's hardware ID, that policy will be used regardless if the MSDSM-wide
 policy is set or not.

  Examples:
    For setting 'MPIO Disk2' to Fail-Over Only with pathId 0000000077030000 set
    to Active/Optimized and be the Preferred path for Failback:
       mpclaim -l -d 2 1 0000000077030000 0 0 1

    When Fail-Over Only is already set for 'MPIO Disk3' and pathId
    0000000077030000 is set to Active/Optimized, to set pathId
    0000000077030000 to Standby and pathId 0000000077030001 to
    Active/Optimized:
       mpclaim -l -d 3 1 0000000077030000 2 0 0 0000000077030001 0 0 0

    For setting 'MPIO Disk1' to Round Robin with Subset with pathId
    0000000077030000 to Active/Optimized and pathId 0000000077030001 set to
    Standby state:
       mpclaim -l -d 1 3 0000000077030000 0 0 0 0000000077030001 2 0 0

    For setting 'MPIO Disk4' to Weighted Paths with pathId 0000000077030000 set
    to Active/Optimized and path weight of 25:
       mpclaim -l -d 4 5 0000000077030000 0 25 0

    To clear the LUN-level load balance policy for 'MPIO Disk1':
       mpclaim -l -d 1 0

    To display detailed information for 'MPIO Disk5':
       mpclaim -s -d 5

    When viewing or setting load balance policies with the '-d' switch,
    the MPIO disk number is used to address the disk. For a mapping of MPIO
    disk numbers to system disk numbers, use:
       mpclaim -s -d

    To set the default load balance policy of all LUNs controlled by MSDSM to
    Least Queue Depth:
       mpclaim -l -m 4

    To set the default load balance policy of all LUNs matching hardware ID
    'VendorIdProductIdentifer' to Least Blocks:
       mpclaim -l -t VendorIdProductIdentifer 6

    To show the currently set target-wide load balance policies:
       mpclaim -s -t
